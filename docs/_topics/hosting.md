# Hosting

## Shared / Web hosting 
- many sites on one server
- low cost and low control
- great for simple sites and beginners

## VPS (Virtual Private Server) 
- a virtualized slice of a server with dedicated resources and root access
- more control and performance
- needs more admin work

## Cloud hosting 
- workloads run on a pool of virtualized resources across many servers (regions/zones)
- highly scalable and resilient
- many managed services available

## Dedicated hosting 
- an entire physical server reserved for you
- maximum control and performance
- higher cost

## Managed hosting / PaaS
- provider manages infrastructure and platform 
- e.g: managed WordPress, Heroku
- less operational burden

## Serverless / FaaS 
- you run functions without managing servers (pay per request)
- great for event-driven small workloads

## Reseller / Colocation / CDN - specialized forms: 
- reselling hosting
- placing your hardware in a provider’s data  center 
- global caching for static assets
