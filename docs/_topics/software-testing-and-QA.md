# Software Testing and QA: Quality Assurance

`Test Harness`
- the infrastructure and code you use to run, control, and observe tests for a system
- it wraps the system under test with drivers, fixtures, mocks/stubs, orchestration, logging and assertions
    - so tests can be executed automatically, reliably, and repeatably
