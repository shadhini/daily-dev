# GitHub Copilot

`an AI Assistant for developers`

[GitHub Copilot: How To](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)



## [CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli?utm_source=web-hpace-copilot-cli-primary-cta&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=universe25post)
- a terminal-native AI coding agent that lets you work without context switching
- custom agents to delegate tasks
- access your GitHub repositories, issues, and PRs using your existing account 
- plan and execute multi-step coding tasks (build, edit, debug, refactor)
- ships with GitHub’s MCP; can be configured to talk to a custom MCP server to run private models, enforce policies, or add integrations
- always requires you to preview and approve actions before they run 

## VS Code extension
- OpenAI Codex integration: with a Copilot Pro+ subscription
    - series of AI coding tools that help developers move faster by delegating tasks to powerful cloud & local coding agents
- Agents: run tasks in background
- Context-isolated subagents: delegate focused tasks that can be solved independently of your main chat for context-optimized token usage
    - e.g.: running TDD workflows, conducting research
- Plan Mode: create, refine, and execute step-by-step implementation plans
    - analyze codebase
    - generate detailed execution plans
    - validate that requirements are covered before starting to code
