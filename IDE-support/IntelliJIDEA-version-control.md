## Git Rebase

If there are commits in your upstream branch that you want to apply to your local branch, 
- `git fetch`
- select the branch and select the option `Rebase <FEATURE BRANCH> onto <UPSTREAM BRANCH>`
before pushing your changes to the remote repository.

### Interactive Rebase from here ...
- `Fix up`: add to the previous commit
- `Squash`: merge commits
- `command` + `return` â†’ to return after editing the commit 

## Change `changelists`

## Shelve Changes
